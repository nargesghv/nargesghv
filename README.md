# 👋 Hi, I’m Narges — AI Engineer & Creative Technologist

I specialize in building **real-time intelligent systems** at the intersection of **Computer Vision**, **Agentic AI**, and **Immersive Technologies** (AR/VR). My mission is to design AI that doesn’t just *observe* the world, but **understands and acts within it**.

---

## 🚀 What I Do

- 🔍 Developing **multi-agent pipelines** that blend **YOLOv8**, **LangChain**, and **LLMs** to power real-time perception and reasoning.
- 🕶 Creating **spatially aware AI** integrated with **Unity** and **WebXR** for next-gen human-machine interaction.
- 📈 Building intelligent platforms like **RealEstate-Forecasting-Platform** that turn noisy data into actionable predictions.
- 🧠 Tuning foundation models (LLMs) with **custom datasets**, **RAG systems**, and **prompt engineering** to solve domain-specific challenges.
