# 👋 Hi there, I'm Narges!

I'm a passionate AI engineer focused on building **real-time intelligent systems** that combine Computer Vision, Agentic AI, and AR/VR technologies.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🎯 Currently building real-time vision systems combining **YOLOv8** + **LangChain** + **Unity/WebXR** and **RealEstate-Forecasting-Platform**.
- 🧠 Passionate about **Agentic AI**, **Real-Time Computer Vision**,**Immersive Technologies (AR/VR)**, **LLM**, **Fine Tuning**, **Prompt Engineering**.
- 🌎 I love working on open-source projects that bridge the gap between perception and action.
- ✨ Always exploring the frontiers of **AI for interaction**, not just observation.
